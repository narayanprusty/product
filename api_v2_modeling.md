## Design Notes
- Consistency: use canonical format for addresses e.g. 0x[20_bytes_suffix] and not byte arrays.
- Large results set support via pagination. Every response which returns a list of data items should have pagination support built-in. However, streaming pushed server results should contain all data and no pagination hints as the client is not expected to call the server for additional data in this use case.
- In methods that return enum values, we should always return the enum int value and not just string representation of an enum. For example /v1/gettransaction returns the status string e.g. 'confirmed' but not status id. e.g. 2.
